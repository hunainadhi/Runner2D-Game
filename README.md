# Runner2D-Game
I have always been addicted to videogames since my childhood and use to think about how do people make such stuff. 
Recently I started learning C# scripting and Unity and was able to build my very first game.

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hunainadhi/Runner2D-Game
```
Open the project in Unity and Build
